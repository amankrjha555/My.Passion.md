# How To Ask Questions The Smart Way
* If we ask any question to anyone, then they should ask clear and well understood.
 
* More generally, if you write like a semi-literate owl, you will be ignored a lot. 

* Use tips such as doing a Google search on the text of any error message you receive (use Google Groups as well as web pages). It may well take you right to fix the authentication or mailing list thread that is answering your question. 

* One good convention for subject headers, used by many tech support organizations, is “object - deviation”. The “object” part specifies what thing or group of things is having a problem, and the “deviation” part describes the deviation from expected behavior.

### Example:-

Stupid:

    HELP! Video doesn't work properly on my laptop!
Smart:

    X.org 6.8.1 misshapen mouse cursor, Fooware MV1005 vid. chipset
Smarter:

    X.org 6.8.1 mouse cursor on Fooware MV1005 vid. chipset - is misshapen
# How you ask is as important as what you ask.
* When you ask questions, you should be acutely aware that you are defining the parameters of your curiosity or ignorance. This definition is what guides the person designated to answer the question.
