# What work did you get 
 + We got a google excel sheet in Self Evaluation and Others Evaluation and we copied it.
 + After that we had to find the average of self and others with the formula of the algorithm.

# How to write formulae

* =SUM(COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Excellent")*5,COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Very good")*4,
COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Good")*3,COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Satisfactory")*2, COUNTIF(C4:J4,Fair)*1,
COUNTIF(C4:J4,"Poor")*0)/COUNTA(C4:J4)

# How does the formulae work
+ At first he is sum up all the value.
+ Then he is dividing.
+ Syntax = SUM(COUNTIF(range,"string1")*number1,COUNTIF(range,"string2")*number2)/COUNTA(range)

# Objective of Exercises
+ I learned about the algorithm.
+ I learned about the excel sheet to use.
+ I learned about use the algorithm formula in an Excel sheet.

# How it was Implemented
+ I used sum function.
+ Used countif function.
+ Used counta function.
+ Used average function.

# Explanation of Implementation
+ The SUM function adds values. 
+ You can add individual values, cell references or ranges or a mix of all three. 
+ For example: =SUM(A2:A10) Adds the values in cells A2:10.

# Test Result

# Conclusion
