# What was the best happy moment

## My happy moment was that I had received a new phone
* I did not have a phone and all my friendsÂ  had a phone, so I told my brother that I also want a phone. So he gifted me a new Android phone on my birthday, so it was the most happy moment for me.

# What was the most disappointing/ Saddest moment

## My saddest moment was that I was in an accident at night
* The worst day with me was the day when I was coming home from a relative's house around 11:00 pm. On the way to and from the bicycle, I got hit by a scooty while the scooty one was coming from the wrong side but nothing happened but the front wheel of my bicycle was jammed by the tucker and the night had also turned my head The phone was also disturbed and no one was going to go, but how could I not have reached the house at 2 o'clock in the night, and when I reached home, everyone in the house was upset for me, this moment was the worst for me.
