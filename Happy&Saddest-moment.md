# मेरा सबसे अच्छा पल कौन सा था। 

## My best happy moment was that I had received a new phone
* I did not have a phone and all my friends  had a phone, so I told my brother that I also want a phone. So he gifted me a new Android phone on my birthday, so it was the most happy moment for me.

# What was the most disappointing/ Saddest moment

## मेरा सबसे दुखद पल यह था कि मेरे साथ रात में एक दुर्घटना हुई थी। 

* TThe worst day with me was the day I was coming home from a relative's house at around 11:00 pm. On the way to and from the bicycle, I bumped into Scooty, while the one with Scooty was coming from the wrong side. But nothing happened to me but the front wheel of my bicycle was hit by collision. No one else was going to ride, but I reached home at 2 o'clock in the night, and when I reached home, everyone in the house was upset for me, so this moment was the worst for me.
